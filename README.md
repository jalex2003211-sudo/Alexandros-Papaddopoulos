# Alexandros-Papaddopoulos

Software engineer focused on production-ready systems: clean architecture, reliability, and automation at scale.
Enterprise background in Java automation frameworks and CI-integrated execution. Side projects emphasize modular design, offline-first workflows, and typed domain models.

## What I optimize for
- Clear module boundaries (domain vs UI vs infrastructure)
- Deterministic core logic and testability
- CI discipline and reproducible workflows
- Refactoring legacy code into reliable, maintainable components

## Selected work
- **Onera (React Native / TypeScript):** offline-first mobile app with a custom session engine and UI separated from core logic.
- **SoseToExamino:** product-first productivity system with structured execution logic.
- **StrongPasswordGenerator (C++):** algorithmic generator with clean separation of responsibilities.

## Growth roadmap
- Harden core logic with deterministic tests and clearer boundaries
- Add release tags + changelog for flagship projects
- Publish one public “automation framework slice” that demonstrates enterprise-level testing/CI patterns
